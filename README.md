# Async Blog Homepage: Data Loading & Typing Fix Edit

## Task Overview
The startup's blog homepage is critical for SEO and first impressions. However, users experience loading flickers, occasional errors, and undefined post titles due to missing TypeScript types and improper asynchronous data fetching. Improving this is crucial for both perception and maintainability.

## Guidance
- The project uses Next.js 13+ App Router with TypeScript.
- Blog post data is fetched client-side from a provided mock API.
- Ensure strong typing throughout: define interfaces for post data and fetch responses.
- Use async/await for data fetching, handle loading and error states, and prevent race conditions or update-after-unmount issues.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by managing state updates efficiently.

## Objectives
- Define proper TypeScript interfaces for blog posts and fetch responses.
- Fetch post data asynchronously and update the UI only after data is available.
- Render a list of blog posts showing title and content.
- Handle cases where loading takes time or errors occur during fetch.
- Avoid issues such as 'undefined' titles, update-after-unmount, and performance bottlenecks.

## How to Verify
- On load, the homepage shows a loading state while fetching posts, then renders the correct post data (title and content).
- No titles or content appear as 'undefined' in the list.
- No React or TypeScript errors/warnings in the console.
- Loading state disappears exactly when data is ready; no unnecessary re-rendering or flickers occur when switching pages.
- Simulate slow network or API errors and confirm these are handled gracefully.
